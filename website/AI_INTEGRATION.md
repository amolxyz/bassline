# AI Integration for Strudel Live Coding

This document describes the AI assistant integration in Strudel's live coding environment, which helps users create and modify musical patterns using natural language.

## Overview

The AI assistant is designed to work seamlessly with Strudel's live coding environment, providing intelligent pattern generation and modification capabilities. It understands Strudel's syntax, pattern-based approach, and live coding workflow.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Pattern Generation**: Create musical patterns from natural language descriptions
- **Live Coding Context**: Understands real-time modification and execution
- **Pattern Transformations**: Apply algorithmic transformations to existing patterns
- **Style Recognition**: Generate patterns in specific musical styles and genres
- **Documentation Integration**: References Strudel's comprehensive documentation

### Context Awareness
The AI is trained with extensive knowledge of:
- Strudel's pattern language and syntax
- Tidal Cycles concepts and mini-notation
- Live coding workflow and real-time execution
- Available sounds, effects, and transformations
- Pattern alignment and combination techniques

## Usage

### Basic Pattern Creation
Ask the AI to create patterns using natural language:

```
"create a house beat"
"make a melodic bassline"
"generate ambient pads"
"create a techno rhythm"
```

### Pattern Modifications
Request modifications to existing patterns:

```
"make it faster"
"add more complexity"
"apply Euclidean rhythm"
"add randomization"
"make it more atmospheric"
```

### Style-Specific Requests
Generate patterns in specific musical styles:

```
"create a jazz piano progression"
"make a hip-hop beat with sampled drums"
"generate ambient drone with long notes"
"create a classical string quartet pattern"
```

### Advanced Techniques
Request complex pattern manipulations:

```
"create a polymetric pattern"
"add voice leading to my chord progression"
"create a pattern with conditional transformations"
"make a generative melody that evolves over time"
```

## AI Components

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt
The AI service includes a comprehensive system prompt that covers:
- Strudel's core concepts (cycles, patterns, events, querying)
- Complete syntax reference for pattern creation and manipulation
- Available sounds, effects, and transformations
- Live coding context and workflow
- Documentation references

### 2. Live Coding Context Component
Provides users with information about:
- Real-time code execution
- Pattern-based approach
- Visual feedback and multiple pattern support
- Tips for effective live coding

### 3. Documentation Reference Component
Quick access to Strudel documentation:
- Getting Started guide
- Workshop tutorials
- Pattern function reference
- Mini-notation guide
- Technical manual
- Recipes and examples

### 4. Enhanced Example Prompts
Organized into categories:
- **Live Coding Scenarios**: Basic patterns to start with
- **Pattern Transformations**: Algorithmic modifications
- **Musical Styles**: Genre-specific patterns
- **Advanced Techniques**: Complex pattern manipulations
- **Sound Design**: Audio processing and effects
- **Interactive Elements**: Dynamic and responsive patterns

## Technical Implementation

### AI Service (`aiService.js`)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o for pattern generation
- Maintains conversation context for follow-up requests
- Includes comprehensive Strudel knowledge in system prompt
- Handles error cases and provides helpful feedback

### Chat Interface (`ChatTab.jsx`)
- Real-time pattern generation and display
- Copy-to-editor functionality for immediate use
- Conversation history for context-aware responses
- Loading states and error handling

### Context Components
- **LiveCodingContext**: Explains live coding concepts
- **DocumentationReference**: Quick access to docs
- **AIExamples**: Categorized example prompts

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Be Specific**: Describe the style, instrument, or transformation you want
2. **Use Live Coding Terms**: Ask for patterns that can be easily modified
3. **Build Incrementally**: Start simple and ask for modifications
4. **Reference Documentation**: Use the documentation reference for learning

### For Developers
1. **Maintain Context**: The AI remembers conversation history
2. **Update Documentation**: Keep the system prompt current with Strudel updates
3. **Test Patterns**: Ensure generated patterns are immediately playable
4. **Error Handling**: Provide helpful feedback for failed generations

## Configuration

### API Key Setup
1. Obtain an OpenAI API key
2. Enter the key in the AI Settings panel
3. The key is stored locally for privacy

### Customization
- Modify the system prompt in `aiService.js` for different capabilities
- Add new example categories in `AIExamples.jsx`
- Extend context components for additional features

## Integration with Strudel

The AI assistant is deeply integrated with Strudel's live coding environment:

### Immediate Execution
- Generated patterns can be pasted directly into the editor
- Patterns execute immediately in the live coding environment
- Real-time modification and iteration

### Pattern Understanding
- AI understands Strudel's pattern-based approach
- Generates patterns that work with the live coding workflow
- Considers cycles, timing, and pattern transformations

### Documentation Alignment
- References current Strudel documentation
- Suggests appropriate functions and techniques
- Provides context-aware recommendations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Pattern Analysis**: AI analysis of existing patterns
- **Style Transfer**: Apply characteristics from one pattern to another
- **Collaborative Features**: Multi-user AI-assisted sessions
- **Advanced Transformations**: More complex algorithmic modifications

### Integration Opportunities
- **Visual Feedback**: AI suggestions for visual pattern representation
